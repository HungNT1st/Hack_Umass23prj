# HackUMass 3D Scanning Project

## Description

Our project aims to create a 3D scanning solution that is both affordable and easy to use. We believe that 3D scanning technology has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries, from choosing clothes and seeing if they fit well with personalized 3D models, to creating personal human avatars for games or joining the Metaverse.

Our goal is to build a solution that is fast and accessible under the constraint of time in the hackathon. We figured the best way to achieve this is to only use AI for cropping the iamge and then sculpt the 3D model manually using Blender since training the model for converting from 2D to 3D would cost us a lot of time.

Please enjoy your time here!
